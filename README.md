# B2B Web Store - Bachelor Thesis Project

In this project, the e-commerce store has been developed using modern web technologies such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Strapi CMS. Next.js is a React-based framework that allows for server-side rendering and easy creation of high-performance web applications. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined styles for common components and allows for easy customization. Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that provides a flexible content management system for the e-commerce store. These technologies have been used to build a fast, responsive, and scalable e-commerce store that meets the needs of B2B customers.
