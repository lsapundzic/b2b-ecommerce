# Project Immediate To-Do List

[ ] Looking into possible options for server-side fetching and rendering

[ ] Look into fetching data and storing it in React's *context provider* as a way to enable SSR.

[ ] Data fetching & **error handling** in the fetchData.jsx is unclear, possibly redundant.

[ ] API URLs and URL constructors are not implemented or not working properly.

[ ] Responsive design generally not working, particularly on products page.

[ ] Project metadata in root layout.js is disabled, it does not work on the client side.

[x] There is a partially resolved problem with AntD dark/light theme that impacts the navbar element

[ ] Add a Header component with company name, logo, and possibly a search box

[ ] Organize styling components
